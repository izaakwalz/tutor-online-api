It is given that the solid in the first octant is bounded by the graphs of  z = 1 −  2 ,y = 2x and x = 3.The volume of a solid can be evaluated as: V =∫∫∫dV Here  dV is the product of d x d y d z. The limits for the given case are given: x → 0 ≤ x ≤ 3y → 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 x z → 0 ≤ z ≤ 1 − y 2 Therefore: V = ∫ 30 ∫ 2 x 0 ∫ 1 − y 2 0 d zd y⋅ d x V = ∫ 30 [y − y  33 ] 2 x 0 d x V = ∫ 30 [2 x−( 2 x ) 33] d x V = ∫ 30 [2 x − 8 x 33] d x V = [2 x 22 − 8 x 43 × 4 ] 3  0 V = [32 − 2 × 34 3] V = − 45 Thus, the volume of the solid in the first octant bounded by the graphs  z = 1 − y 2,  y = 2 x and x = 3 is equivalent to  − 45 units 3."

A variable is an alphabet that represents the value that can be change.   A constant is a value which will remain same. A numerical expression contains only numeric constants and operations like addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (×) and division (÷). An algebraic expression contains both numeric and variables constants and also operations like addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (×) and division (÷).  How to evaluate an expression? To evaluate an expression is to find its value of the expression. In solving the questions on variables and expressions some of the key words and phrases play an important role to translate between algebraic expressions and words. To evaluate algebraic expressions we need substitute the given values for the variables and simplify to find the value of the expression.  Addition (+) is also known as plus, sum, increased by, put together, combined Subtraction (–) is also known as minus, difference, less than, find how much more or less  Multiplication (×) is also known as times, product, equal groups of, put together equal groups  Division (÷) is also known as divided by, quotient, separate into equal groups",
